3. When was sample_textdoc.txt first saved? What does the Modification time indicate?



4. What are the MAC timestamps for Notes.csv? What is the most likely reason that the Modified date is earlier than the Created date? 

5. Look at another document.txt's MAC timestamps. What is the most likely reason that the Modified date is earlier than the Created date?
a. Bonus: What are another document.txt's MAC timestamps in UTC?
